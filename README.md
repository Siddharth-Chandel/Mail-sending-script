## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.x.
- Install any required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install smtplib email

Make sure to enable "Allow less secure apps" in your Gmail account or generate an App Password.

### 2. Code Example
You can directly call the send_email function from the script as follows:
```bash
 send_email(
    receiver_email='recipient@example.com',  # Recipient's email
    sub='Test Email',                       # Subject
    text='This is a test email.',           # Email body
    sender='youremail@gmail.com',           # Sender's email
    password='yourpassword',                # Sender's email password
    img=['path/to/image.jpg'],              # Optional: Attach image(s)
    attach=['path/to/file.pdf']             # Optional: Attach file(s)
  )
```
### 3. Function Parameters
receiver_email (str): Email address of the recipient.
sub (str): Subject of the email (default: 'Program Info').
text (str): Email body text (default: '').
sender (str): Sender's email address. If None, the script fetches credentials from environment variables.
password (str): Sender's email password. If None, the script fetches credentials from environment variables.
img (str or list): Optional. Path(s) to image(s) to include in the email.
attach (str or list): Optional. Path(s) to file(s) to attach to the email.

### 4. Using Environment Variables
To securely store your email credentials:

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export Gmail_ID='youremail@gmail.com'
export Gmail_Passkey='yourpassword'
```
Call the function without providing sender and password:
```
send_email(
    receiver_email='recipient@example.com',
    sub='Secure Email',
    text='This email uses environment variables!',
    img=None,
    attach=None
)
```
### ðŸ›  How It Works
